# HabboNFT P/L Calculator

 ### What is HabboNFT P/L Calculator?
HabboNFT P/L Calculator will generate an excel file for every NFT shop collection showing the profit/loss you would have made if you bought the items with the current NFT credit price.

### I have never touched code before
- Download python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the run.bat file and the plcalculator.py file
- Click run.bat

### I know how to open and edit code
- On line 2 is the collections dictionary where you can add new collections
- You can unquote (remove the #) on line 58 and 59 to get a JSON file output. Just like the example.json file.

### I can code in python
- For your own sanity don't read my code

### I got an issue
- If you have a problem, if no one else can help and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.
